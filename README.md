# Guac-A-Mole

[Play it here!](https://jessevermeulen123.github.io/Guac-A-Mole/)


## Description

Guac-A-Mole is a game where the player has to click on avocados that spawn randomly to keep them from filling up the grid on screen. The cursor will be turned in to a mallet that will be used to smash the avocados. The game ends when the player has missed three avocados. The player wins when they pass all the rounds with at least one life in tact. 


## MVP

- game has a mallet cursor
- avocados spawn randomly on the grid
- avocados with pips will spawn and require to be clicked twice 
- you win by collecting as many avocados as possible during 60 seconds 
- time countdown 
- missing an avocado will make you lose a "life" 
- if you lose all your lives you lose the game
- increasing difficulty
